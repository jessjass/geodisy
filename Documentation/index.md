# Geodisy

## The world of data at your fingertips

**Find research data visually, spatially and quickly**

**Geodisy** is a software tool, specifically middleware, that harvests data from a data repository, such as [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) and makes it available to a map based user interface, in this case [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org).

Using the web-based interface, end users will be able to find data which has previously only been discoverable by text-based searches rather than location-based searches.

You can try out Geodisy by looking at Canada's Federated Research Data Respostory, FRDR. [Try it!](https://geo.frdr.ca)

For more information, please have a look at the [factsheet](factsheet.md)
